# RDSO - Responsible Mapping

This Responsible Data Science Opportunity addresses the challenges with responsibly and effectively communicating spatial 
data to stakeholders and the public.


## Situation

You're preparing to present your findings, and you’ve chosen to include maps as part of your deliverable. Your analysis involved narrowing the focus to specific MVA (Market Value Analysis) blocks and individual parcels. Now, you need to communicate not just the outcomes of your analysis, but also the reasoning behind these spatial selections.

Stakeholders—including local officials, community groups, planners, and residents—will want to understand:
 - Where your targeted your search
 - Why these specific parcels were selected
 - How they relate to surrounding features of interest

Your challenge is to present your findings in a way that is both clear and responsible, ensuring that maps provide context, avoid bias, and communicate your decision.

## Lenses

* **Stakeholder mapping lens**: "Who might be affected by the inclusion of this variable, and how might different stakeholders view its use?"  
Develops collaboration skills: Helps you consider diverse perspectives and anticipate concerns

## Feedback on Decisions
### Color Scheme (communication)
✅ DO: Use a the correct symbology to show trends in continuous and sequential variables (e.g. years delinquent, amount delinquent, grade)  
✅ DO: Convey different variables using different symbology.

### Color Scheme (responsibility)
❌ DO NOT: using color schemes with unintended social meanings.  E.g. Using a color scheme that gets progressively 
redder for lower-grade MVA blocks.  
✅ DO: Use color schemes that are colorblind-accessible 

### Showing Context
✅ DO: Show other parcels nearby your selection.  
✅ DO: Show other relevant geographic context

## Effective Communication
✅ DO: Use a legend  
✅ DO: Allow users to interact with map
