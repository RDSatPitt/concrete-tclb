Land Banks typically get special permission to purchase abandonded properties and sell them to individuals in the community for below market rates.

    "**Parcel**": Parcels are the smallest distinct units of land in a municipality. For these purposes, it may help to think of a parcel as what a homeowner would call their "property" -- you don't usually think about just their house, but also their yard, their driveway, or whatever else is inside their "property". That said, all sorts of land can be a parcel: city parks are parcels, the buildings at school sit on parcels, warehouses and hospitals are on parcels too.

    "**Polygon**": In GIS terms, polygons are one of three vector features that can be represented on a map (along with points and lines). Polygons have at least three lines that form the border of a shape (much like polygons in the context of geometry). Typically, parcels in a town are polygons.

    "**Multipolygon**": Multipolygons are multiple polygons that, together, represent a singular entity. The US map would be represented as a multipolygon (with its 48 connected states, Alaska, Hawaii, and other territories).

    "**Municipality**": For our purposes, we can think of municipalities as local areas that have their own system of local governance. The city of Pittsburgh is a municipality (has a mayor and a city council), but the neighborhood of Central Oakland is not a municipality. Allegheny County has 130 municipalities, including Ross Township, Plum Borough, Monroeville municipality, and more.  

    "**Tax Delinquency**": If you have not paid your taxes on time, you are said to be tax delinquent. If you eventually do pay your taxes, you can exit tax delinquency (in other words, 'tax delinquency' is not a permanent state or label).

    "**Liens**": A penalty assigned to someone who is tax delinquent. Liens are debts that are attached to properties or other large-value possessions. If you have a lien on your house and you sell it, the lien has to be paid off before you receive money from the sale.""")

    Now that we've loaded various datafiles with information about the county's parcels and TriCOG's borders, we can begin to find parcels that fall within those borders. You may remember from the introduction that finding parcels within TriCOG's boundaries was our first objective. And it's an important one! State law only allows TriCOG to operate within a certain boundary, so it is crucial that the properties included on your list of recommended acquisitions be within those boundaries. 

    In order to achieve this goal, we'll need to know what the TriCOG boundaries are, and what parcels are inside them. `tricog.geojson`, which we loaded in the last step (and saved as `tricog_df`), has both the names of the municipalities (towns, boroughs, and such) where TriCOG can operate, and it also has the geospatial borders for each of those municipalities.  

    Two of the dataframes that were generated in the previous step were read from files that have county-wide parcel data: <br> 1. `assessments_df` (from the assessments.csv file) has text data about the parcels, including the names of the municipalites each parcel is inside of.<br>
    2. `parcels_df` (from the parcels.geojson file) includes geospatial data, allowing you to see where the parcels are located on a map.
    <br>

    We can use Python to compare the parcels' municipality names listed in `assessments_df` to the allowable municipality names in `tricog_df`, or we can compare the location of each parcel from `parcels_df` to the location of the municipalities in `tricog_df`.<br>

    Do you think it's better to start with `assessments_df` and analyze the text? Or is it better to start with `parcels_df` and analyze the geospatial data? In the form below, select which dataframe you think would make a better choice to work with. Then, in the text box, explain why you think that choice is the best. (Don't worry too much, you can always go back and re-choose later if you change your mind!)<br>

You can think of clipping like using a cookie cutter on cookie dough; the clip function returns only the features (dough) that fell within the overlay layer's boundaries (cookie cutter).

                    The process of `iteration` involves moving through an object one piece at a time. Once you've performed your action, you move on to the next object and repeat the process. In this specific example, we would `iterate` over the `parcels_df` dataframe by going through it row by row: we would ask, "is the "pin" from this row found in the `liens_df` dataframe? If so, we could add the lien amount to `parcels_df`; if not, we would move on to the next row in `parcels_df` and ask the question again. This would have less contextual data from `liens_df` in the output, but also may not take up much more space than the initial `parcels_df` object (since we are only adding one additional column).<br><br>
                    With `joins`, we combine the data from two dataframes together. In this process, we would wind up with a new dataframe that has all of the columns from both dataframes. We would retain the context from both dataframes, but the object may wind up being rather large to accommodate the data from both original dataframes.<br><br>
                    Having said that, which process do you think we should start with, and why? Don't worry too much about your choice if you are unfamiliar with these methods -- we can discuss them further after you've made a selection. You can always go back and switch your choice if you'd like. For now, it's just important to set out your initial thoughts about the choice."""),

                    Imagine for a second that you are a parent, and you've been keeping track of your child's height and weight every year on their birthday: you saved their height in a file named 'height', and their weight in a file named 'weight'. If you wanted, you could perform a join on these two files to create a new file, 'height and weight'. In this exaple, the object that is the same across the two files is the child, and the column that is the same in both files is the child's birthday. If 'weight' says that the child weighed 35 lbs on their 4th birthday, and 'height' says the child was 3 ft tall, you would use the 4th birthday as the link, and 'height and weight' file would say the child was 35 lbs, 3 ft tall. <br><br>"""),

                    One way to think about the types of joins is to think about folding socks. Any time you wash socks, you need to pair them up and put them away. But it's easy for socks to get lost in the process, so you might have some left and right socks that no longer have a mate. If you were to perform an inner join on your socks, you would only keep socks that still form a pair. A left join on the socks would mean you keep all of the matches as well as any left sock that's lost its match. A right join would mean you keep all of the matched socks, as well as all of the right socks that have lost their mate.<br>

            With data, an inner join returns a dataframe that only contains rows where there was a match on your specified column. Left joins would return all rows from the "left" dataframe; matched rows will have the data from the "right" dataframe, and the other rows will have null values in those columns. Right joins return the opposite: all rows from the "right" dataframe are returned, and matched rows will contain the data from the "left" dataframe.<br><br>"""),

                    One of the difficult questions of working with large data is knowing whether or not an end product is correct. Take this dataframe, for example: is this output what we were looking for? Does it contain only properties that meet the stated requirements?<br><br>
                    Perhaps counterintuitively, these are two distinct questions. The values within the output dataframe do meet the requirements -- they are all parcels within TriCOG's operating boundaries that are single-family homes with liens against them. This may not be what we were looking for, though. <br><br>
                    Remember that we are trying to identify abandoned properties, and we are using tax liens as a proxy. However, liens can be assessed against a property for a number of reasons (not just abandonment). Take a look at the range of lien values: the lowest lien amount in the dataframe is `${list(final_output.total_amount.sort_values())[0]}.` This hardly feels like the result of abandonment; it could just be clerical or human error instead.

                    Take a look at the slider below. The slider adjusts the amount we consider as the lower-bound lien amount for considering that a house is possibly "abandoned". As we move the slider, we can see how this impacts the total number of houses that would be included in our output dataframe. Try it for yourself; move the slider to various amounts and look at how many houses remain at that level. """),

And while you would eventually realize the houses were not abandoned if you actually attempted to purchase them, the act of doing so could create stress for individuals and make them feel as if their housing is insecure. The role of your organization is to find homes for people and build community; making people feel uncertain about their current housing goes against the broader work you're trying to do. <br><br>
                    It would be impossible to come up with a dataframe that reflects the real world housing situation 100% accurately, so an important task of yours is to consider what distortions and tradeoffs are being made to represent the real world as data, and how to balance those tradeoffs while creating the least amount of harm.""")
